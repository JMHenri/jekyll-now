Hello, welcome to my blog. This isn't my personal blog, it is meant for my technical topics and posts. Topics covered include general web application security, and general full stack development.

### Note
Security and Architecture posts do not reflect the current state of vetpool.ioâ€™s security posture or architecture. They are created to share our ideas, developments, and to in general, make coding less confusing and more robust for everyone.
