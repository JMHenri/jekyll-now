title: One-Man MEAN Stacks : Keeping Assets Safe in a Server Breach
---

Note: Security and Architecture posts do not reflect the current state of vetpool.io's security posture or architecture. They are created to share our ideas, developments, and to in general, make
coding less confusing and more robust for everyone.

For many small business owners and small projects. All you can afford with your time and money is a simple, pre-defined full stack, with some additions and hardening based on your unique needs.

In my case, I'm running a typical, simple MEAN stack, setup on AWS. My website does however require high security, because it manages a large volume of assets.
Also, since this is the blockchain, a data breach can result in losing everything. There are no banks to keep me safe, and it's not just a few emails.

So I needed something that was foolproof. No matter how badly things went, even if my server is compromised, customer funds must be safe.



Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
